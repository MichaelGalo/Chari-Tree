          <p className="text-lg mb-8">
            After spending around a decade working with non-profit organizations and B-Corp brands, I've noticed several patterns that Impactree aims to address:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-6 mb-8">
            <li className="text-lg">
              <strong>Easier access to meaningful impact:</strong> Fighting for causes you believe in and finding organizations that implement impactful solutions shouldn't require you to be a detective or internet sleuth.
            </li>
            <li className="text-lg">
              <strong>Willingness to contribute:</strong> Unless someone is looking for in-person volunteer opportunities, people are often eager to give financial or other resources to impact causes they believe in.
            </li>
            <li className="text-lg">
              <strong>Time-efficient decision making:</strong> With limited time and energy for research, people often rely on word-of-mouth or trusted recommendations to direct their philanthropy funds.
            </li>
            <li className="text-lg">
              <strong>Inclusive impact:</strong> Individuals from all socioeconomic backgrounds desire to help others, but some may feel their donations aren't making a significant impact based on the limited ability of organizations to communicate with some of their smaller figure donors. 
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-lg">
            With Impactree, no matter how big or small your donation intentions are, you will discover charities easily & track your impact with clarity. We believe that sowing seeds of change will grow into many branches of impact, and it's our desire to empower you to watch your tree grow.
